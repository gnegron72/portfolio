Use the guidance below to help craft and continue to guide the structure and content of the portfolio:

  Engineer roles - you have the rare combination of deep
  technical skills and proven product/business acumen. Here's a
  strategic portfolio framework:

  Portfolio Structure: "Technical Product Builder"

  Hero Section: The Bridge Between Technical & Product

  Positioning Statement: "Technical Product Manager with 16
  years of experience - I build products by writing code, not
  just specs."

  Key Value Props:
  - 11 years software engineering → 5 years product management →
   Current program management
  - From concept to deployment: I prototype, architect, and ship
   products
  - Rapid technology adoption and solution delivery

  Core Case Study: NFL Office Pool - "Zero to Production in 
  [timeframe]"

  Section 1: The Product Challenge

  - Business Context: Personal project to solve a real user need
  - User Problem: Complex weekly predictions, group management,
  authentication
  - Success Metrics: Active users, group engagement, technical
  reliability

  Section 2: Technical Product Strategy

  "How I approached this like a TPM":
  - Technology selection rationale (why TypeScript, MongoDB,
  Google Cloud)
  - Architecture decisions balancing speed vs. scalability
  - Feature prioritization and MVP definition
  - Integration strategy (OAuth, NFL data, email systems)

  Section 3: Full-Stack Implementation

  "How I delivered like an engineer":
  - Frontend: React architecture, responsive design, user
  experience
  - Backend: TypeScript APIs, database design, authentication
  - Infrastructure: Docker containerization, CI/CD, cloud
  deployment
  - Code Quality: 106+ unit tests, TypeScript strict mode,
  comprehensive error handling

  Section 4: Product & Technical Evolution

  - Feature roadmap decisions and technical debt management
  - Performance optimization and scalability considerations
  - User feedback integration and iteration cycles

  Technical Deep-Dives (Expandable Sections)

  Architecture Overview

  - System diagram showing data flow
  - Technology stack rationale
  - Scalability and security considerations

  Code Samples

  - Well-documented snippets showing problem-solving approach
  - Database schema design
  - API design patterns
  - Testing methodology

  DevOps & Deployment

  - CI/CD pipeline setup
  - Cloud architecture
  - Monitoring and reliability

  Call-to-Action Section

  "Ready to build products that scale"
  - Contact information
  - Link to recorded demo
  - GitHub repository (if comfortable sharing)
  - Technical resume/LinkedIn

  Key Differentiators for TPM/FDE Roles:

  1. "I don't just write PRDs, I write code" - Show you can
  validate technical feasibility firsthand
  2. "Rapid prototyping to product" - Demonstrate speed from
  concept to working solution
  3. "Technical debt as product decision" - Show you understand
  technical tradeoffs impact business outcomes
  4. "User-centric engineering" - Emphasize how technical
  decisions serve user needs
